## Art Direction

The art style is chosen as pixel art. This style is only to use four (4) colors: a background, foreground, and two accent colors. These colors can be adjusted in the options menu.

Later revisions will include more colors, but at the start only '4' will be used.

In code, a 'color replacer' will be implimented to allow for 'palette swapped' versions of artwork. A spritesheet, original palette, and destination palette will be required to function.

# Art Style

The stylization will reflect certain console titles from the 90s. Either *Bio-mechanical* or *Robotic* enemies can be encountered. There will also be several space-born biological entities.
